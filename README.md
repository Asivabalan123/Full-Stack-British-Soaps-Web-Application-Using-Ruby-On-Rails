# Full stack web application using Ruby on Rails

This project is deployed on Heroku: https://floating-wave-81922.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up.

To access the blog you need to sign up and then login.

This is a full stack web application called British soap listing producers for British soaps. Each user can add, edit and delete producers into this blog space. When the user clicks on the show button, they will be able to add a soap for each producer and make reviews on their opinions for each soap that is submitted. This is essentially an app so users can put across their thoughts for each soap or if they want to know more about any particular soap, then they can find out through other users reviews. When you add a producer the first name and second name field cannot be empty otherwise it will render back on the same page. Each user can also delete the reviews uploaded if they wish to do so.

In my sprint two, I will be adding an admin user, so they can view and delete all data submitted on this blog space. A comments section for producers will also be included, so users can put across their views on the executive producers for each Soap.  More styling will also be added to make the web application more visually pleasing and each user would be able to upload an image of each producer when submitting information about them.
